This presentation covers the basics of installing a SQL client before diving into 
examples of SQL queries that perform some more analytical and data sciencey tasks. 
There are 2 important setup steps before running these queries: 

1. Install the DBeaver SQL Client by going to http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/download/
2. Download the DBeaver project profile that we've created for this presentation. 
The profile contains the connection credentials, the driver libraries, and all 
of the SQL scripts mentioned in the presentation. Here is the link to download that profile:
